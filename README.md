# LoadoutSpawner

## What is that mod for?
I am a fucking lazy person.
Yes I got that BiS HK416, please let me spawn it and get into a raid.

With this mod, you'll be able to spawn your favorite weapon/preset in one click, without having to deal with merchant stocks or whatever I can think about.

In the future, you'll be able to spice your gameplay a bit with the ability to start a raid with a random loadout. Just wait a bit, I'm working on it.

## Installation 
Open the archive and drag and drop both folders to your SPT installation

## Credits
